- **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?** The DriverPass project aims to provide enhanced training to drivers looking to obtain a license. The project observed that many drivers fail their DMV test on their first attempt and offers a combination of online and in-person training to better a driver's chances at passing their first try. The clients for the system are the many drivers who would benefit from the additional training offered. DriverPass wants a modular and platform independent system that makes things easy for customers and the business itself.
    
- **What did you do particularly well?** I believe I showed great care in analyzing processes and business needs from the available DriverPass interviews and transforming them into various models detailing the process flows, acitivities, objects, and expected technical details of the system.

- **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?** Although I believe the details contained within the documents are comprehensive, I have an opportunity to improve my visual styling in conveying the information for large diagrams.

    
- **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?** By reading the interview thoroughly and creating outlines for the hopes and needs of each possible stakeholder, I was able to craft a system design that effectively considered the user's needs. The user's needs are important for a system like DriverPass because the entire premise of the company is to improve the ability of drivers to ace their DMV tests.

- **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
My style of designing software in my career has often focused on crafting small proofs of concept to test the feasibility of a project. This works well in some circumstances, but I believe I have learned much greater techniques for project planning that I'll incorporate into future efforts. Although I've usually been successful with my more lightweight upfront analyses, there have been times where ad-hoc changes have been more challenging than necessary due to poor planning.
